I've actually seen supermarkets use the term interchangeably, which is why I decided to do more investigation into the differences between the two.  For sure, if it's a new flavor, it will help all of you when you need to cook with it for the first time.</p>\n<p>Let's go to taste and smell first.  All the other technical stuff I'll address later.</p>\n<p><strong>Taste and Smell</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Galangal:</strong>Smells like strong menthol, Vick's Vapor Rub and pine.  The taste of galangal is accompanied with a strong kick of menthol and pine.  There is a slight bitterness and then a cool pepperiness.  The spice lingers on a tongue for a short while and then dissapates.</p>\n<p>__Ginger: Smells a lot more mellow than galangal.  Ginger has a light, sweet, spiciness to it.  In terms of taste, ginger starts off mellow and sweet, and is then followed by a mild pepperiness.  The taste is not nearly as strong as galangal.</p>\n<figure>\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;  max-width: 1037px;\">\n      <a class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\" href=\"/static/6675ee12d9c5d6258b8c6d2a68e16400/e1ae5/245-3.jpg\" style=\"display: block\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 66.63452266152362%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url(&apos;data:image/jpeg;base64,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&apos;); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"245 3\" title=\"245 3\" src=\"/static/6675ee12d9c5d6258b8c6d2a68e16400/e1ae5/245-3.jpg\" srcset=\"/static/6675ee12d9c5d6258b8c6d2a68e16400/90185/245-3.jpg 450w,\n/static/6675ee12d9c5d6258b8c6d2a68e16400/7288a/245-3.jpg 900w,\n/static/6675ee12d9c5d6258b8c6d2a68e16400/e1ae5/245-3.jpg 1037w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1037px) 100vw, 1037px\" loading=\"lazy\">\n  </a>\n    </span>\n</figure>\n<p><strong>Other comparisons</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Galangal is more expensive than ginger </li>\n<li>In terms of appearance, galangal has a much darker, brown-amber skin.
