We've all seen the cookies decorated with ghosts, spiders, or gravestones... and the cupcakes with the over-the-top, in-your-face bright orange frosting sprinkled with black and orange jimmies.  I wanted to move away from the familiar, and make Halloween just a bit more...sophisticated - sophisticated, but still super fun!

I wanted to stay away from artificial ingredients (yes the pictures have sprinkles on them...), so I added black sesame powder to the p√¢te a choux puffs and made pastry cream using pumpkin puree, which not only provided a natural sweetness, but made the cream bright orange as well.

You can be as creative as you want in decorating these guys.  Once you have the puffs filled, it's a matter of creating some legs with chocolate and sticking them right in to make spiders.

Tips - the hard part about this recipe is probably the pastry cream as the egg can easily curdle.  But if you temper the eggs prior with a little bit of the hot liquid and make sure the heat is turned down to medium, you can control how the mixture thickens a lot better.  And because we have the gelatin in there, you don't have to worry too much about whether you have heated the mixture to the exact point where it will thicken later.  Any lumps that do form can be strained out and you will have the perfect pastry cream.
