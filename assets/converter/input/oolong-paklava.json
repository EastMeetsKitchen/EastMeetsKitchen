{"description":"No, no.  I didn't spell it wrong.  Paklava, spelled with a 'p,' is Armenian baklava.  The two are very similar, but there a couple differences between them.  For one, paklava has a sugar-based syrup flavored usually with lemons while baklava's syrup is made with a significant amount of honey, which I happen to enjoy.","title":"Oolong Paklava","pic":"img/79-1.jpg"}
