No one ever shows how to make the shells of the Chinese egg tarts.  It's similar to puff pastry, but more tender and less dry.  It includes layering a 'water dough layer' with an 'oil dough layer' similar to puff pastry, but each layer has some flour in addition to fat content. Didn't mention in the video that these are freeze-able as well. Recipe:(Makes 12  2 1/2-inch shells) Oil Dough: 7 tablespoons lard or shortening, 1/3 teaspoon salt, 2 drops butter flavoring, 2/3 cup cake flour; Water Dough: 1 tablespoon lard or shortening, 1 teaspoon vegetable oil, 3 tablespoons water, 2/3 cup cake flour, 1 tablespoon sugar
