{"description":"This is a doughnut recipe I did for Vitasoy in their baking with tofu campaign.  The doughnuts are still light and fluffy, but with a fraction of the calories.  And the red azuki bean filling adds a lightly sweetened filling that provides a ton of moisture to the doughnuts.  Directions and recipe follow.  A video of the recipe can be found here.\n","title":"Red Bean Doughnuts","pic":"img/116-12.jpg"}
