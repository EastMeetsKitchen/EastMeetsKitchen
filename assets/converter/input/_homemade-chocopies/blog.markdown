So, I'm not the biggest fan of Choco Pies.  I think they're cute looking, but taste really artificial, dry, and plastic-y.  The chocolate coating has no chocolate flavor at all, which is a bit unfortunate for something with chocolate or "choco" in its name.  That being said, after Pocky sticks, Choco Pies are one of the most well-known Asian packaged snacks there is, so I knew I had to re-make it...and make it better.  The cake had to be moist and the chocolate had to taste like chocolate.  I mean, I'm not going to perform miracles here. Choco Pies are still essentially a fluff cake sandwhich with chocolate on top, but at least it will taste better.  And yes, it was definitely fun to make.

My trick behind making the cakes was to use muffin tins or even better if you have it, whoopie pie tins.  They're straighter on the sides and mimic the Japanese imagawayaki shapes better.  Because all cakes sort of bake with a bump on top, a good tip for making these Choco Pies are to level off the cakes with a knife before assembling.  That way, you'll get nice even surfaces to work with, which will result in a more professional-looking Choco Pie.
