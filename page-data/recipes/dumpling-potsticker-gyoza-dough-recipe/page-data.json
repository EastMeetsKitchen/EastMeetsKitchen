The brilliance of this recipe is that you can use it as the wrapper for any dumpling, gyoza or potsticker recipe.  It rolls out as thin or thick as you want and fries up nice and crispy.  You can also steam the dough and get steamed dumplings that way.</p>\n<p>What most people don't know is it's used as the base recipe for scallion pancakes as well.  You can create a more advanced recipe by adding fat/oil in between the layers and creating a more flakey scallion pancake, but for a quick and easy recipe, most Chinese restaurants end up just cutting in some scallions and maybe adding some sesame or sesame oil to the mix.</p>\n<p>I think I've talked about hot water dough some time before, but adding boiling water changes how the gluten behaves in the flour. It's almost like you are cooking the dough first and that creates a softer texture with less pull-back from the gluten and dough.  That means you can roll out the dough pretty thin and have no trouble.  Of course, the dough isn't fully cooked and still retains characteristics of a dough.</p>\n<p>It's really basic and you can dress it up or down as much as you want, but it always fries and steams up (make sure to oil the surface to prevent sticking) beautifully. </p>\n<p><strong>Directions</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>In a bowl, mix together the flour and salt.</li>\n<li>Using chop sticks or a fork, gently mix in hot water until it is loosely combined. </li>\n<li>Add in room temperature water and mix till loosely combined. </li>\n<li>Finish dough by kneading with hands for3-4 minutes until it comes together.</li>\n<li>\n<p>Set aside for 1 hour before use. </p>\n<section class='recipe'>\n<p><strong>Ingredients</strong></p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>(Makes about 30 medium-sized dumpling wrappers)</p>\n<p><strong>Dough</strong></p>\n<ul><li>2 cups flour</li><li>1 teaspoon salt</li><li>2/3 cup boiling water</li><li>1/2 cup cold water</li></ul></section>","timeToRead":1,"excerpt":"So another name for this dough is 'hot water' dough.
