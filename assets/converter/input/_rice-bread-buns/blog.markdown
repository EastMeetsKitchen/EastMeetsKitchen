For true food enthusiasts, it is always difficult finding "healthy" recipes that fit our standards for flavor, texture, and just utter yumminess. I'm always looking for healthier ways to have the same foods I love, but not compromise the flavor.  Every once in a while, I come across something that is not only healthy, but really changes a recipe for the better.

I'm going to show you how to make rice buns as a substitute for bread buns.  I know a lot of you sandwich enthusiasts are cringing as we speak, but give this a try.  It's amazing how much a little salt and a touch of olive oil adds to the flavor of the rice buns.  Along with the crunch, it's almost like having chips as your bread - delicious.  I wanted to differentiate this recipe from just rice cakes.  Rice cakes are puffed and dry due to the nature of how they're made.  This recipe still has the chewiness and moisture from the rice, but is nicely crisp from frying it in olive oil.  Because the rice patties are crisped on both sides, it also is better for sauces because it won't soak in and make the rice buns soggy.  This recipe can definitely be done with brown rice as well, just remember to really compress the rice down because it has a tendency to break apart when frying when it is not properly packed down.

(Tip for cooking.  Make sure to really pack down the rice into the molds.  Do not disturb the patties while they brown because this will make them stick.  Once it has been browning for about 4-5 minutes, either shake pan or use a spatula to loosen.)
