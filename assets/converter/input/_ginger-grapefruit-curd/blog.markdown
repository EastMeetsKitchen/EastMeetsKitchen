I love grapefruit and one of my favorite things to do with it is to make grapefruit curd.  I put the curd on top of cookies, muffins, scones, and even fill them in little pie tins to make tarts.  I think grapefruit definitely offers a nice twist to your typical lemon curd because grapefruit has that bitterness that really adds a depth of flavor to the curd.  By the time you add your sugar - even though the bitterness is still there, it just matures the curd making it a bit more sophisticated tasting.

Now, grapefruit curd is fine by itself, but I decided to add yet another twist to this.  I love mixing citrus with something spicy and ginger does just that, but in a way that is so complimenting that it makes the citrus flavor pop.
