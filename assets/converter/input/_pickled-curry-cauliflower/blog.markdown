I first discovered curry pickled cauliflower at this southern kitchen/restaurant in Somerville, Massachusetts called M3. The restaurant is known for its chicken and waffles (I may do a review on them later), but I think they should be known even more so for their creative sides.  

Curry pickled cauliflower.  I don't even know what to say about it other than it is utterly delicious.  I had never thought of pickling cauliflower before, but the hearty texture of the vegetable really lends itself to pickling. Even after 1-2 weeks in the jar, the little chunks of cauliflower still have that crunchy bite to them.  And as if that sweet and sour pickling brine wasn't delicious enough, there are hints of curry in these sides as well.  It's not overpowering, but puts the flavor of curry and vinegar together making for quite the delectable combination, not to mention the beautiful almost fluorescent yellow the curry powder produces.

Anyways, I tried out the "Hurry Curry" recipe from the Food Network and the recipe is down below.  I will say that flavor-wise, I would prefer my pickles less sweet, so you guys may want to taste the brine a bit before putting it in the jars.  Also, this recipe doesn't lend itself too well to photography as the brine gets very cloudy quickly because of all the ingredients in the cauliflower.
