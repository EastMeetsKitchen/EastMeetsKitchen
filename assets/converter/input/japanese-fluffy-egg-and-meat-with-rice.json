    "description": "A chef friend of mine recently gave me the book 'Japanese Women Don't Get Old and Fat: Secrets of My Mother's Tokyo Kitchen' to read.  She knew that when I'm cooking at home, I like eating 'clean' dishes - not too oily, not too seasoned - just good food that feels good going down.  I also happened to tell her I wanted to find more 'home-cooked' Japanese recipes and so she dropped this book off for me.",
