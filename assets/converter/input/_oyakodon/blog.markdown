This is one of the most simple, yet delicious rice dishes I think I've had in a Japanese restaurant.  Oyakodon, which translates into "parent and child rice bowl," is a dish where chicken and eggs are cooked with a sauce and then spooned on top of a bowl of rice.  It's filling in that it satisfies all of the necessary senses - savory and sweet.  And the good thing - you can usually find most of these ingredients in your pantry.

I have a couple of substitutes though in case you don't have some of the more unusual ingredients.  (I actually didn't have dashi when I made this the first time and substituted for a little chicken broth.)

Dashi - can be substituted for chicken broth + salt or miso soup if you have it

Mirin - japanese rice wine, can be substituted for Chinese rice wine which is cheaper and a bit of sugar.  If you just have normal white vinegar, I would suggest diluting it a bit with water just to take off that edge and then adding a teaspoon or so of sugar to sweeten the vinegar as mirin is a sweetened rice wine.
