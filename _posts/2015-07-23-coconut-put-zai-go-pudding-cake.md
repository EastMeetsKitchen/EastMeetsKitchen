So, it's definitely not pudding. Put zai go is sort of like if I could make you a cake with gelatin, but have it be firm enough to have good bite and chewy and stretchy enough to offer you a little give and take.

That's not the best description, I know.  But I think it's worth trying just because it's such a different recipe. Put zai go (more like "boot jai go") is a very popular Cantonese treat, which used to be sold from carts. For convenience, vendors would stick wooden skewers into them, so that they could be carried around easily.

This is a pretty simple recipe, but the proportions have to be pretty exact, so make sure you measure.  I tried a ton of recipes using various rice flours and starches and what I found was this recipe could easily get too gummy or too hard from an overabundance of starches or rice flour if the portions are off.  It's obviously personal preference how exactly you like your put zai go and if you choose to make this recipe again, the amounts of flour and starches can be tinkered with to get the deserved stretch and bite.
