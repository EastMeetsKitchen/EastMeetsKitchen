{"description":"Congratulations to both France and Germany for the win.  I'll get straight to the menu as I probably bit off a little more than I can chew trying to cook 2 dishes during the work week.  However, I'm quite excited about these two because we are heading towards the entree part of our meal and both games today included such diverse cuisine.
