It's mid-July and I thought this refreshing osmanthus, chrysanthemum jelly would be the perfect recipe to cool us all down.  It's light, floral-y, and sweetened with honey.

There a a ton of benefits to osmanthus and chrysanthemum.  Both are rich in antioxidants and are calming for the body.  Osmanthus provides an apricot-y and floral note while the chrysanthemum gives a soothing floral touch.  Depending on what type of honey you use, that can also contribute to the flavor.

A small note for those who are not familiar with agar - it's a gelatin-like substance that comes from algae.  It's not as "springy" as gelatin and I would liken it more to the texture of fruit jellies when they are set with pectin.  Definitely check out my [tips on working with agar](http://eastmeetskitchen.com/tips/working-with-agar.html).  You need to make sure all the agar is melted over heat before it will set.
