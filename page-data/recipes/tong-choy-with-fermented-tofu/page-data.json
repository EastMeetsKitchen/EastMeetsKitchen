Not to give too much away, but it was on Asian spring foods and I think it will be a very interesting read.  In the wait for spring, I just wanted to give you a snip it of the recipe to one of my favorite Asian vegetables called \"tong choy.\"  It's a crunchy straw-like green that provides excellent crunch - in case you all were worried about cooked greens.  </p>\n<p>Most Asian supermarkets carry tong choy and if they carry tong choy, they should carry the fermented tofu that traditionally pairs with this green.  I have to say that the fermented tofu smells sort of like a creamy, spicy, canned fish - if that could happen.  That being said, it gives a wonderful creaminess and spiciness to the greens.</p>\n<section class='recipe'>\n<p><strong>Ingredients</strong>\n- 1 bunch tong choy\n- 2 - 3 cubes fermented tofu\n- dried red pepper flakes (optional)</p>\n<p><strong>Directions</strong>\n1.\tWash stalks thoroughly and cut stalks in half so that the bottom stalks are separated from the top leaves.\n2.\tIn a pot of boiling water, cook stalks for about 3 minutes.  Then put in leaves and cook for an addition 1-2 minutes.\n3.\tDrain and add several cubes of fermented tofu into the greens.  Mix until cubes are creamy and well combined.</p></section>","timeToRead":1,"excerpt":"Hey All, I recently did an article for the spring issue of Audrey Magazine that will be coming out in March.
