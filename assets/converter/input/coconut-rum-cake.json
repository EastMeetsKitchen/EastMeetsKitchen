{"description":"I’m not a big fan of frosted cakes. I usually find them unnecessarily sweet, and I don’t like how the flavors of the frosting cover up the flavors of the cake.  I do, however, enjoy cakes when they are coming right out of the oven.  They're warm and moist and flavorful.","title":"Coconut Rum Cake","pic":"img/80-1.jpg"}
