The waitress gave me an abundance of chopped scallions to accompany my soup.  I sparingly sprinkled a few granules of salt into my soup, but could just as well have enjoyed the flavorful broth in its pure, rich simplicity.</p>","timeToRead":1,"excerpt":"After trying one of the best Korean sundubu jjigaes (tofu soups) at Kaju Tofu House in Harvard Square, I was on a quest to find more amazingâ€¦","frontmatter":{"title":"Seoul Soulongtang","image":{"feature":{"publicURL":"/static/122-1-f56c9b81436299ab81e2e9e54b3a7724.jpg","childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,/9j/2wBDABALDA4MChAODQ4SERATGCgaGBYWGDEjJR0oOjM9PDkzODdASFxOQERXRTc4UG1RV19iZ2hnPk1xeXBkeFxlZ2P/2wBDARESEhgVGC8aGi9jQjhCY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2P/wgARCAANABQDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAGQAAAgMBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAUBAgME/8QAFAEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAv/aAAwDAQACEAMQAAABXM6QFqcQX//EABwQAAICAgMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABAxECBBIhJP/aAAgBAQABBQLjiy5KTsl8plvdK5T/xAAXEQADAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAREx/9oACAEDAQE/AbMEf//EABYRAQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABEAAf/aAAgBAgEBPwEYy//EAB8QAAIBAwUBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABAgMhIhETMnGBof/aAAgBAQAGPwKyZjRaOcvSNRZdmu39HOTuf//EABwQAAMAAQUAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABESExQVFhgf/aAAgBAQABPyFtXJ9EioWcREVhzUKaBm5BBUW9l9cD2R//2gAMAwEAAgADAAAAECQP/8QAGBEAAgMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAERITH/2gAIAQMBAT8QuDOMP//EABgRAAMBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABESEx/9oACAECAQE/EHDR06f/xAAeEAEBAAICAgMAAAAAAAAAAAABEQAhMUFRwXGBof/aAAgBAQABPxCPRMJ28z1gIzwGj8W+8CR10BD2ToOPrCjrEDxPNW4oEZqiH5isHbNBo4z/2Q==","aspectRatio":1.5,"src":"/static/f56c9b81436299ab81e2e9e54b3a7724/06c35/122-1.jpg","srcSet":"/static/f56c9b81436299ab81e2e9e54b3a7724/00e5e/122-1.jpg 200w,\n/static/f56c9b81436299ab81e2e9e54b3a7724/1a903/122-1.jpg 400w,\n/static/f56c9b81436299ab81e2e9e54b3a7724/06c35/122-1.jpg 726w","sizes":"(max-width: 726px) 100vw, 726px"}}}},"feature_video":null,"date":"2015-03-16","categories":["blog"],"tags":["blog"]},"fields":{"slug":"/blog/seoul-soulongtang","date":"2015-03-16T00:00:00.000Z"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/blog/seoul-soulongtang","nextslug":"/recipes/speckled-chocolate-macaroons","prevslug":"/recipes/macau-almond-cookies"}}}
