No one ever shows you how to make the shells of Chinese egg tarts.  This is because it's one of the harder recipes to make - similar to puff pastry, only the result comes out more tender and less dry.  Most recipes you get are an iteration of a shortbread dough, which is yummy and quick to make, but tastes nothing like the actual Chinese egg tart crust.

The technique includes layering a 'water dough layer' with an 'oil dough layer' and folding - again, similar to puff pastry, but each layer has some flour added in addition to the fat content. I didn't mention this in the video, but these are shells are freeze-able as well.
