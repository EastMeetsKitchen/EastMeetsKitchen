{"description":"So another name for this dough is 'hot water' dough.  The brilliance of this recipe is that you can use it as the wrapper for any dumpling, gyoza or potsticker recipe.  It rolls out as thin or thick as you want and fries up nice and crispy.  You can also steam the dough and get steamed dumplings that way.\n","title":"Dumpling, Potsticker, Gyoza Dough Recipe","pic":"img/174-1.jpg"}
