This banana muffin recipe is one of the recipes I've tested the most, probably because my family is such big fans of banana nut bread.  But because they were such big fans and ate banana nut bread so often, the pressure was really there to make them as healthy as possible.  It would be silly to continue feeding your family something they ate all the time, but was bad for them.

I wanted this morning item to be something to carry them throughout the day.  I wanted it to be something they didn't need to worry about eating. In fact, I wanted the muffin to actually be good for them when they ate it.

Of course, you can make anything as healthy as you want, but if it's not good, nobody is going to eat it.  And so the journey of developing the perfect muffin began.  

It helps that banana muffins are naturally dense and heavy in banana flavor.  Any substitutions you do on the basis of health that might affect flavor or texture are normally masked.

I wanted to highlight a couple of ingredients that were substituted, which is worth noting.  

1. Dates for sugar - It's been a belief of mine that if you want to add sweetness from let's say apples or prunes or dates that you should use the whole fruit because that's accompanied with the fiber naturally found in it.  True, it can make the baked good more dense, but because we are dealing with a naturally dense baking good, the substitution works.

2. Olive oil for butter - So make sure to use a light olive oil for this because many times olive oil is too strong in flavor.  That being said, one of the only oils truly proven to be good for you is olive.  When you substitute an oil for a butter in a cake, the end product is actually lighter, which in our case works because we are adding some ingredients which can make our product more dense and this balances it off.

3. Garbanzo flour for all-purpose flour - I really advocate using flours that add value to health and because all-purpose flour is stripped of a lot of it's nutrients and fiber, using it results in empty calories for the eater.  Garbanzo flour is obviously packed with protein and fiber.  Because it can add a stronger flavor to the muffins and also a slight denseness, I advocate cutting it with a lighter gluten-free flour.
