Tips - When folding or sealing the dumplings, try not to be too fancy.  If you end up folding the bottom like an accordian-style, a lot of the times, that bottom layer gets too thick and you get a greater proportion of the dough than you want.  Other than that, the texture and moisture of the dough needs to be just right and I've discussed that in my [vegan har gao recipe]()

The keep with these vegan lion's head meatballs is to handle them gently and avoid overworking the wheat gluten.  The combination of starch, flour and oil all work together to minimize gluten formation resulting in more tender meatballs.

2. In a separate bowl, mix together the flour, salt, baking powder and baking soda.
3. Add the flour mixture into the yeast liquid.  Then add in the coconut oil.

6. Dough can be rolled out, filled, or shaped into balls.  
7. Place dough, filled or otherwise, onto parchment paper.  
8. Place into steamer and steam for 12 minutes.  Buns can be frozen after it has cooled.
