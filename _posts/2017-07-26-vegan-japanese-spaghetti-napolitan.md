### Directions

1. Add 2 tablespoons of oil to a pan over medium high heat.  Fry vegan hot dog slices about 2 minutes each side until sides are crispy.
2. Add in the onions, garlic, bell pepper and mushrooms.  Turn the heat down to medium and cook 3-4 minutes until the vegetables have softened.
3. Mix together the tomato paste and 1/4 cup of water.  Add it to the vegetables along with the pasta and ketchup.
