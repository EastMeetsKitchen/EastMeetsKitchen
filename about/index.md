Christina Ng is a Boston-based baker and blogger.  She grew up watching Julia Child cooking shows every Saturday morning – time she should have spent preparing for her piano lessons.  Growing up in a massive Chinese family that celebrated anything and everything with a Chinese banquet, Christina got sick of Chinese food early on.


It wasn’t until after university when she went abroad to Asia to study and work that she developed a true appreciation for Asian food and culture.  She specializes in the local and authentic recipes that she grew up with and those, which she learned through her travel. East Meets Kitchen is her attempt to revive those recipes, which maybe anonymous to the world, but are served on kitchen tables daily.
