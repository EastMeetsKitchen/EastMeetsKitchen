{"description":"Pecan pies aren't just a Thanksgiving thing.  I love them year round - munching on crunchy pecans in an ooey gooey, buttery brown sugar filling...I mean, who wouldn't?  But the issue  I always hear with pecan pies is that it is overly sweet.  Well, if you make it yourself, you control the sweetness...and can add flavors that will make pecan pie a year-round anytime favorite.","title":"Spicy Cayenne Pecan Pie","pic":"img/95-1.jpg"}
