There's a fear in baking that I don't see as often in cooking, and I think the reason is that there's a lot more that can go wrong with baking  Once you commit, you can't really improvise or adjust as you do in cooking  But there are baking rules to live by and these are the ultimate tips I hear from bakers to make your baked goods bake up to tip-top form

__1 Use a scale__

I've talked about this [tip](http://wwweastmeetskitchencom/tips/scale-a-must-havehtml) before, but baking is about ratios 3 parts flour to 2 parts fat to 1 part liquid  These "parts" aren't measured with spoons or cups because a cup of water doesn't weigh the same as a cup of flour or a cup of butter  

All parts are measured based on weighted measurements and when cookbook authors develop recipes, they most likely use a scale and only at the end do they try to convert those weighted measurements to cups and spoons (and even then, it's hard to get the measurements to be exact)

__2 Room Temperature Ingredients__

Room temperature items enable some ingredients like eggs to reach its maximum volume when whipped  But having ingredients at room temperature also ensures that all ingredients are better able to be mixed homogeneously  And if you know anything about baking consistently amazing goodies, you know that your mixtures need to be the same throughout

__3 Using your senses to bake__

This might be the top tip to keep in mind whenever you bake  Professional bakers know that conditions vary from kitchen to kitchen - in terms of ovens, stoves, altitude, humidity, and even the ingredients themselves  How do you know when a cake is finished baking?  Certainly, don't just base it on the suggested time given  You check the cake for color You smell it You feel it with your hands to see if it bounces back

__4 Mix dry  Mix wet Add dry to wet__

When looking at a recipe, it is important to understand how the ingredients get incorporated  In many baking recipes, you mix all the dry ingredients together until they are homogenous throughout  You do the same thing for the wet  Then you gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ones until everything is incorporated  When using this general method, note that sugar is usually considered part of the "wet" portion

__5 Do not over-mix  Finish by hand__

This is recipe dependent because there are recipes like ones for breads that do require a fair amount of mixing to develop the gluten structure  But for a majority of baked goods like muffins, scones, and cakes, it's a good rule to mix with the mixer until about 90% of the ingredients are incorporated  Then, finish the final 10% using a spatula  It's hard to over-mix when using your hands, so this method ensures that everything gets combined without being overworked

__6 Every oven is different Adjust accordingly__

I never understood why those bakers on Cupcake Wars always had issues baking up their cupcakes, especially when that's what they do every single day  Other than for producer sabotages (which I've totally read about), it has everything to do with ovens  Unless you get your ovens calibrated on a normal basis, every oven in every bakery or home kitchen will be different  

It's smart to check your baked goods at around the half-way point or several minutes prior to when they are done to make sure they are done and don't get over-baked  If at the half-way point, you notice your cupcakes or muffins aren't baking up as they do normally, you might want to increase or decrease your oven temperature by a tad  It's also good to note that a professional convection oven is always about 50 degrees (Fahrenheit) hotter than normal home ovens

__7 Egg wash gives everything that "golden brown" color__

Golden brown - that's a chef's favorite color  All too often though, home cooks don't know that in order to get that healthy golden hue, bakeries need to brush their baked goods with egg wash before baking  That golden brown color hides any flaws that might be visible and definitely makes baked goods look a whole lot more appetizing

__8 Use Scoops__

Scoops ([good quality ones](http://wwwwebstaurantstorecom/search/vollrath-jacob%27s-pridehtml)) have changed the way I bake and the result of my baked goods  First, it's a million times quicker and easier to just scoop out muffin batter rather than to shakily spoon 3 tablespoons of it into a muffin tin and getting it all over the place  Second - and don't confuse this with thinking that all your baked goods will look mass-produced -  all your baked goods will end up the same size because it has the same amount of mixture in them  Everything bakes up more evenly for this reason as well  Scoops can still make baked goods look rustic, but just "professionally rustic" - and I think that's the type we all aim for


__9 Knowing when to rotate__

Even with convection ovens, bakers still rotate their baked goods, even if it's just to check to see how the pastries are baking up  Typically, most recipes tell you to rotate at the half-way point, but I've learned that sometimes, opening the oven too early can hurt baked goods because they haven't baked up enough yet and may deflate when moved  Especially for batter-based goods, it's a good idea to rotate at the three-quarters point  That way, the goods will have had time to bake up and the rotation will still help the goods evenly bake

__10 Scrape down the mixer__

This tip is especially relevant for when you're dealing with larger amounts of ingredients  Many times, ingredients get stuck to the bottom or sides of the mixer without ever getting incorporated  What you end up with is a batter or dough containing big lumps of butter or sugar or flour that is not fully incorporated and it will show when it bakes  So it's a good idea to scrape down the mixer and then mix for another 30 seconds or so until everything gets incorporated
