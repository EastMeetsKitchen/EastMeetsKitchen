I had the biggest craving for Cinnabons last Sunday, but with the nearest Cinnabon shop 45 minutes away, I opted to find a recipe and make it instead.  Now this is just an inkling, but I think I don't actually like the Cinnabon cinnamon buns themselves, although they are very good.  I mean, I've tried many recipes before, and all cinnamon rolls - at it core "dough and cinnamon" foundation - tastes about the same.  I think what I actually like is the Cinnabon frosting, which is sort of the traditional butter, cream cheese, and confectioners sugar frosting. But I feel that tiny bit of tang from the cream cheese really cuts the sweetness, making for an absolutely addictive cinnamon roll.

I thought this recipe was very similar to the real Cinnabons, but the dough could have been a bit softer.  I know Cinnabon probably slathers on a ton more butter that this recipe calls for, so that might be something you can do at home.  However, I also used King Arthur Bread Flour because bread flour was what the recipe called for.  King Arthur is known to have a lot more protein/gluten content in their flour, so that definitely made for a tougher dough.  I would maybe try to either do this entirely with all purpose flour next time or maybe do a half and half combination.  It's just that with the bread flour, I felt the dough hardly rose because of the tougher structure, and rolling it out became a pain because of the bread dough's tendency to retract.  The directions call for a bread machine, but if you don't have that, make sure to knead the dough for at least 5 minutes until everything is combined before letting it rest.

A note is that I cut this recipe in half to make 6 cinnamon rolls, but you can always double to make more.  However, when you do roll out the dough, make sure that the length stays at around 21 inches.  It is the width that changes since that will be what you use to divide up the cinnamon rolls.
