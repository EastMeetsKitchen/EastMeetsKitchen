Bleaching changes the characteristics of the proteins and starches in the flour, allowing it to be more elastic and better able to hold gas, so while this recipe does the trick for a majority of recipes, it might not lead to the exact same results for some others. </p>\n<p>Some tips - just remember to sift well because the cornstarch can get lumpy and not evenely distribute.
