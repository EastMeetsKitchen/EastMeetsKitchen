This is my first time making homemade pop tarts and oh my gosh, am I glad I did.  This probably goes as one of my top, favorite recipes.  The crust was one of the most flakey and crumbly crusts I've ever had. It makes the pop tart.  And because I had breakfast in mind (though I had all my pop tarts midday...like 5 minutes after they came out of the oven), I made a brown butter coffee drizzle to go over the top -- SO GOOD.

__3. Combine egg and milk for egg wash. Brush the edges of the dough and put on the top rectangles pressing down with fingers to seal the edges. Using the tines of a fork, make indentations along the edges.__
