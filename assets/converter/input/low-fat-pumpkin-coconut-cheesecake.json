{"description":"This is an amazing cheesecake that I paired up with Vitasoy (think tofu) to create for their holiday campaign last year.  The flavors of coconut and pumpkin pair so perfectly together because although both are mellow flavors, the sweetness from the pumpkin makes the coconut more pronounced.  The flavors turn into this fragrant and creamy concoction, which surprisingly is done without a lot of fat.  ","title":"Low-Fat Pumpkin Coconut Cheesecake","pic":"img/116-10.jpg"}
