When I was 13, it was button mushrooms...never liked mushrooms before.  Then several years later, it was New York cheesecake - bad thing to start liking.  This year though, it was brussels sprouts.  I know...weird!  I didn't grow up with brussels sprouts, so it's not like I ever really experienced the \"grossness\" that is brussels sprouts as a kid.  I think what really happened was I had some brussels sprouts for a side at some restaurant I was eating at and was like, \"Whoa!  These are good!\"  </p>\n<figure> <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;  max-width: 640px;\">\n      <a class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\" href=\"/static/db74cdb7bf2e677ed574b70052e6bdd1/7459a/58-2.jpg\" style=\"display: block\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 75%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url(&apos;data:image/jpeg;base64,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&apos;); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"58 2\" title=\"58 2\" src=\"/static/db74cdb7bf2e677ed574b70052e6bdd1/7459a/58-2.jpg\" srcset=\"/static/db74cdb7bf2e677ed574b70052e6bdd1/90185/58-2.jpg 450w,\n/static/db74cdb7bf2e677ed574b70052e6bdd1/7459a/58-2.jpg 640w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" loading=\"lazy\">\n  </a>\n    </span> </figure>\n<p>It's a weird thing to start liking, I know.  I mean, they're sort of miniature cabbages, and yes, at times, I do sort of get that \"sewer-esque\" smell that brussels sprouts and cabbage have.  But, that doesn't turn me off like it does some people.  I think that \"smell\" contributes to the overall flavor that is the brussels sprout, and I love it.  I've tried preparing them several ways - stir fry, steamed, but no way is better that just oven roasted. So I'm just going to give a simple recipe for these - in case there are people like me who aren't so familiar with brussels sprout either.  I think the biggest mistake you can make is over cooking them, because you do want the crunch to stay.  At the same time, I like when parts of the brussels sprouts brown up, so the way to get the best of both worlds is roasting at a high heat, but only for a short period of time.     </p>\n<section class='recipe'>\n<p><strong>Directions</strong>\n1. Cut root off of 1/2 pound of Brussels sprouts and split in half.\n2. Toss with 3 tablespoons of Olive oil, 1 teaspoon of lemon juice, and plenty of salt and pepper to taste.\n3. In a preheated 400 degree oven, roast Brussels sprouts for 8 minutes.\n4. Remove from oven and toss with an additional tablespoon of Olive oil.  Add additional sal to taste.</p></section>","timeToRead":1,"excerpt":"Every couple of years, I develop a new craving for some random food.
