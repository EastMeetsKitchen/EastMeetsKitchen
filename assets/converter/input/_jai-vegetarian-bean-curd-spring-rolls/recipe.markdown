**Ingredients**
- 1 package of bean curd sheets
- 2 carrots (cut into matchsticks)
- 3 stalks celery (cut into matchsticks)
- 6 water chestnuts (cut into matchsticks)  
- 4 shitake mushroom (cut into matchsticks)
- 1 king mushroom (cut into matchsticks)
- 2 cloves garlic (chopped), 
- 1/2 tablespoon grated ginger
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1/2 tablespoon sugar
- 1 teaspoon soy sauce
- 1 teaspoon sesame oil
- 1/4 teaspoon white pepper
- 2-3 tablespoons cornstarch

**Directions**

1. On medium high heat, add 1-2 tablespoons of oil to pan.  Add in garlic and ginger and fry for 30 seconds to release the flavor.  Add in vegetables and mushroom along with the salt, sugar, soy sauce, sesame oil, and pepper.  Stir fry for about 2 minutes.  Set aside and let cool.
2. Deglaze pan by pouring 3/4 cup water into pan.  Reserve the liquid.
3. Using a paper towel or brush, lightly moistened the bean curd sheets  front and back with the deglazing liquid.
4. Place several tablespoons of the filling towards the bottom of the sheet.  Fold the left and right sides towards the center and roll up.  Remember to press down after each roll to ensure that it is tight.  
5. Steam the rolls for about 15 minutes and let cool.
6. Using a paper towel, lightly dry the outside of the rolls.  Lightly dust the outsides with a little cornstarch.
7. On medium-high heat, fry the spring rolls about 1-2 minutes per side until golden brown.  Drain on paper towel.
8. Cut into slices and serve.*
