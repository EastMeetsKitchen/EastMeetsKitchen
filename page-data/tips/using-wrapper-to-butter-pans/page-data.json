This is more true when you keep butter at room temperature because the butter sticks to the wrapper when warm, but a good way to reduce this waste is to use the wrappers to butter your pans.</p>\n<p>Even if you don't have much butter stuck to the wrapper, you can always just cut a small chunk off.</p>\n<p>This tip helps two-fold.  First, you don't have to randomly cut off a piece of butter from a new stick at the very end of your baking session.  Second, by using the butter on the wrapper, it reduces waste and mess.  It keeps your hands clean from having to touch the butter directly. And if you use a brush to butter your pans, you save yourself from having to wash that, which can be a total pain.</p>","timeToRead":1,"excerpt":"I always see a ton of butter leftover on butter wrappers that people throw away.
