**Buffalo Chicken on Rice Cake**                
- 2 slices buffalo chicken deli meat - 30 calories
- 1 white cheddar rice cake - 40 calories
- 1 teaspoon garlic aioli mustard - 30 calories
- 1 small handful arugula - 0 calories (about 4 calories per cup)

Now, that basically comes in at 100 calories per open face sandwich.  And like I said, if it doesn't fill you up, have two - I think that's more my typical lunch anyway...unless I want a quick snack before dinner or something.  And including ingredients that are flavor rich (yes, do look out for sodium content as well) does help with the craving and does away with the thought that all you're eating is a sandwich made from rice cakes.  Give this one a try because it is absolutely delicious and really puts down that craving for potentially fattier foods and/or other junk food.
