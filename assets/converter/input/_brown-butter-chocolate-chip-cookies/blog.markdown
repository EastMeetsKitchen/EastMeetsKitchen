I'm always on the search for really, really good chocolate chip cookies. For as often as people make them, there’s really only a handful of recipes or bakeries, for that matter, that make drop dead good chocolate chip cookies.


Anyhow, I came upon this recipe from Cooks Illustrated that essentially uses brown butter as its butter portion in the cookie.  There are two advantages I see immediately, and three if we’re counting the amazing toffee flavor that this browning adds to the cookies.  One - no creaming of the butter.  That’s the part I dislike the most about making cookies.  Butter flies everywhere and if you don’t have properly softened butter, you basically can’t do it.  Second, and I guess my first advantage alluded to this, you don’t need to remember to take out the butter prior to making the cookies.  This recipe is super easy and the texture and flavor the brown butter creates is like no other.
