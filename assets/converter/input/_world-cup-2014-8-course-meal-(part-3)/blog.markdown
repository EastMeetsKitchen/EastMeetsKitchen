Congratulations to both France and Germany for the win.  I'll get straight to the menu as I probably bit off a little more than I could chew trying to cook 2 dishes during the work week.  That being said, I'm quite excited about these two dishes because we are heading towards the entr√©e part of our meal and both games today included such diverse cuisine.  Both France and Nigeria and Germany and Algeria are so so different in flavors, so it was definitely very fun (albeit a bit stressful) to create the menu for today's games.

Course five includes the classic German schnitzel paired with Algerian couscous.  The schnitzel was pounded to perfection and the crispy texture paired very well with the delicate pearls of couscous.

Course six combines French bread and the hollandaise - one of the mother sauces of French cooking - with suya, which are spicy Nigerian chicken skewers.  The chicken is very spicy, but the richness and creaminess from the hollandaise mellows that down making for a perfect sandwich.
