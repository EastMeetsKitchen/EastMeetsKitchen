After eating kimchi for several days in a row, I needed a change in side dish.  I wanted to find something super easy to make while at the same time, sort of have that slight bite and crunch that kimchi does.  My answer - bean sprouts.

It's basically flavored with typical Korean side dish flavorings - garlic, sesame oil, soy sauce, and maybe some pepper flakes.  Still though, it's a nice savory side dish that adds great flavor and texture when you add it to something like a rice and meat dish.  The thing you might have to keep in mind for this is to not boil the bean sprouts for too long because it gets soft pretty quickly.

And if you're not one to finish a pound of bean sprouts in one sitting, I put the rest of mine in a canning jar.  I'd say it should last fine for about a week.  Afterwards, it all gets a bit soft.
