### Directions

1. Cook wheat noodles according to instruction.  Rinse under cold water and set aside.
2. Julienne the onion and saut√© over medium heat until onion is softened, about 10-15 minutes.
3. Meanwhile, mix the textured vegetable protein with the garlic powder and soy sauce.  Rehydrate with 1 1/2 cups of water and set aside.
4. Using a blender or mortar and pestle, grind the sichuan peppercorns until fine.  Add in the chopped garlic, gochujang, ssamjang, chili flakes, soy sauce and stevia sugar.  Blend until smooth.  Add in water to dilute.  Adjust taste with salt.
5. Once the onions are softened, add the textured vegetable protein into the onions.  Toss to combine.  Add in the blended sauce and cook for about 2 minutes until the textured vegetable protein absorbs the sauce.  (Sauce can be stored in an air-tight container at this point.)
6. Add in the bok choy along with about 1/4 cup of water.  Cook over medium to medium high heat until the bok choy is cooked.
7. Serve over wheat noodles.  Garnish with scallions.
