A lot of people seem to like hauls, so this is going to be of me going to the Chinese grocery store during Chinese New Year.  Some of the ingredients might be odd and quite eccentric, but I'm really hoping these hauls are more educational than anything since I'm someone who loves learning about new ingredients.
