A quick blog about this - I hate being on diets...well I hate gaining an extra 10 pounds and not being able to fit into my pants either, so anyways...

I have this awesome sandwich that I make whenever I do want to lose a couple pounds.  It actually isn't that crazy - I make a couple of substitutes and make sure that whatever is left is 150% flavorful - I think keeping the flavor has something to do with keeping the cravings down too.

It's an open faced buffalo chicken on cheddar rice cake.  I think the good thing about open face sandwiches are that because we have lessened the amount of "bread" and made substitutes to the sandwich, you could easily eat 2 - making it seem more filling -and not feel too badly about it.  Instead of a recipe, I thought I would give you guys a calorie chart instead.
