### Directions

1. Combine shitake mushroom soaking liquid with water to create 1 full cup of liquid.  Whisk in cornstarch and 2 teaspoons of mirin.  Set aside.
2. Add soy sauce and the remaining 2 teaspoons of mirin to the shitake mushrooms.
3. In a large pot over medium high heat, fry ginger in 2 tablespoons of oil for 30 seconds.  Add in the garlic and red beancurd.  Cook for an additional 30 seconds.
4. Add in shitake mushrooms, black fungus mushrooms and beancurd sticks.  Cook for about 1 minute, stirring to coat ingredients with sauce.
5. Add in the baby corn, braised wheat gluten and blanched tofu puffs.  Cook for 30 seconds, stirring constantly.
6. Add in the cornstarch liquid from step 1.  Then add in the mung bean noodles and cabbage.  Cover and bring to a boil. Turn heat to medium and cook for 15-20 minutes or until ingredients soften to the desired consistency.
7. Additional vegetables may be added during the last minutes of cooking.
8. Adjust seasonings to taste.
