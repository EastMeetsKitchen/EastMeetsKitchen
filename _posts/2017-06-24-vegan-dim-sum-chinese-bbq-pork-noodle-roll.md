### Directions

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit. 
2. Pull the jackfruit and place onto a baking sheet.  Bake for about 10 minutes to dry out.
3. Put cooled jackfruit into a bowl.  Add in the char siu sauce, curry powder and garlic powder.  Mix until jackfruit is coated.  Put aside.
4. Steam noodle rolls for 4-5 minutes until softened.  Remove and put into a bowl of cold water. Un-roll the noodles until it becomes a flat sheet.
5. Put some water on the cutting board.  Gently place the rice noodle sheet onto the cutting board.  Sprinkle several leaves of cilantro onto the rice noodle sheet.  Spoon a thin strip of jackfruit onto one end of the noodle sheet.
6. Using a bench scraper, roll the noodle sheets starting from the jackfruit side until a roll forms.  Cut in half and gently place onto the plate.  
7. Reheat the noodle rolls slightly by placing it back into the steamer for 3-4 minutes.
8. For the sweet soy sauce, mix the soy sauce, sugar and water in a bowl.  Pour over noodle rolls when serving.
