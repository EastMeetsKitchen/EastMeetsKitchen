Every restaurant I went to, I would see \"praline tarts\" in the dessert portion of the menu, so I decided to give it a try.  To my surprise, this looked nothing like the pralines I was used to and in fact, the tart came bright red to the table.</p>\n<p>Funny story was that I immediately thought, geez what have I gotten myself into, but also I had the hardest time cutting into this tart.  We'll talk about how to make it later, but this restaurant probably overcooked their filling because the staff had to bring it back to the kitchen and cut it with a big kitchen knife.  I was under the impression that I should just switch desserts because something was clearly not right.  Anyways, the staff gave the tart back to me all cut nicely and so I \"reluctantly\" ate it.  MY GOSH!  This tasted amazing!  The filling, which wasn't the ones that contained the whole almonds in it, was like eating the perfect buttery caramel candy - only the butter wasn't overpowering and the caramel wasn't too too sweet.  Clearly, I was wrong about something being \"wrong.\"</p>\n<p>I later went to Les Halles de Lyon, which is their biggest indoor food market, and Vieux Lyon, which is the old city and saw a ton of Praline Tarts.  The color was bright cherry red and the displays were stunning.</p>\n<p>Praline Tart Displays in Les Halles de Lyon</p>\n<figure> <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;  max-width: 640px;\">\n      <a class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\" href=\"/static/27dd93215213c0ab47952b6fd3242318/7459a/19-2.jpg\" style=\"display: block\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 66.5625%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url(&apos;data:image/jpeg;base64,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&apos;); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"19 2\" title=\"19 2\" src=\"/static/27dd93215213c0ab47952b6fd3242318/7459a/19-2.jpg\" srcset=\"/static/27dd93215213c0ab47952b6fd3242318/90185/19-2.jpg 450w,\n/static/27dd93215213c0ab47952b6fd3242318/7459a/19-2.jpg 640w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" loading=\"lazy\">\n  </a>\n    </span> </figure>\n<p>A Fresh Tart Ready for Sale</p>\n<figure> <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;  max-width: 640px;\">\n      <a class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\" href=\"/static/7956da85ede518201fea97ebb211c847/7459a/19-3.jpg\" style=\"display: block\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 66.5625%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url(&apos;data:image/jpeg;base64,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&apos;); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"19 3\" title=\"19 3\" src=\"/static/7956da85ede518201fea97ebb211c847/7459a/19-3.jpg\" srcset=\"/static/7956da85ede518201fea97ebb211c847/90185/19-3.jpg 450w,\n/static/7956da85ede518201fea97ebb211c847/7459a/19-3.jpg 640w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" loading=\"lazy\">\n  </a>\n    </span> </figure>\n<p>When I got back to the states, I said I HAD to find the recipe for these tarts and make it at home.  Well, after a bit of researching, I found out that the filling is simply the red almond praline candies I saw on the streets of Lyon and heavy cream.  That's it!  I included the recipe from the Lyon city website below.\nNow as simple as this recipe is, the brilliance of the tart comes from the natural red food coloring from the candy almonds, and we don't make red candy almonds in the states!  Luckily, I bought a bag there, but after trying the candy, I think it tastes a lot like our white yogurt candy almonds (and dare I say, sort of like almond m&#x26;ms, but without the chocolate of course).  I'll have to test out the recipe using our US candy almonds because I think the fillers we put in ours will affect the texture of the final caramel filling, but I'll save that for a later date...after I make the tarts first with my red almond candies!</p>\n<p>Almond Praline Candies</p>\n<figure> <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;  max-width: 640px;\">\n      <a class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\" href=\"/static/765ecc11a88f3ae4be13f6094d9b98ef/7459a/19-4.jpg\" style=\"display: block\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 75%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url(&apos;data:image/jpeg;base64,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&apos;); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"19 4\" title=\"19 4\" src=\"/static/765ecc11a88f3ae4be13f6094d9b98ef/7459a/19-4.jpg\" srcset=\"/static/765ecc11a88f3ae4be13f6094d9b98ef/90185/19-4.jpg 450w,\n/static/765ecc11a88f3ae4be13f6094d9b98ef/7459a/19-4.jpg 640w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" loading=\"lazy\">\n  </a>\n    </span> </figure>\n<section class=\"recipe\">\n<p>Praline Tart Recipe from the City Lyon Website</p></section>\n<p><strong>Ingredients for the dough:</strong>\n - 320g of butter (warm)\n - 5g dof salt\n - 200g of icing sugar\n - 66g od almond powder\n - 2 eggs\n - 533g of flour\n - 1 vanilla bean</p>\n<p><strong>Ingredients for the mix:</strong>\n - 500g of liquid fresh creme\n - 500g of french pink pralines</p>\n<p>The evening before, prepare the dough:\n1.
