**Ingredients**
- 1 3/4 cups whole almonds (skins on)
- 3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
- 1 tablespoon grated orange zest
- 1 tablespoon grated lemon zest 
- 1/4 teaspoon fine salt
- 3/4 cup sugar
- 3-4 tablespoons heavy cream
- 2 tablespoons light corn syrup
- 5 tablespoons unsalted butter
- 1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract


**Directions**
1. Preheat to 350 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
2. Pulse the almonds in a food processor to coarse grounds. Stir together the nuts, flour, zest and salt in a large bowl.
3. In a small saucepan, put in the sugar, cream, corn syrup and butter. Cook over medium heat until mixture comes to a rolling boil. Continue to boil for 1 minute. Remove from heat and stir in the vanilla. Pour this mixture into the almond mixture and stir just to combine. Set aside to cool for 30 minutes until cool enough to handle.
4. Roll into two 8-inch logs.  Cut into half inch slices and put onto sheet pan.  Press the cookies slightly with a fork.
5. Bake cookies in the middle rack for about 10 minutes, rotating the cookie sheet after 5 minutes.  Transfer to wire rack to cool.  Cookies maybe put on a paper towel to absorb any excess oil before serving.
