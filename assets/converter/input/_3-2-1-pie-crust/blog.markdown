This is the easy and famous '3, 2, 1' pie crust.  It's 3 parts flour, 2 parts fat, and 1 part liquid - along with some salt and/or sugar for flavor.  Those who have read my post on [ratios](http://www.eastmeetskitchen.com/blog/ratio-a-book-review.html) know that these "parts" are by weight and not volume, so this is when owning a [scale](http://www.eastmeetskitchen.com/tips/scale-a-must-have.html) becomes useful.  

The recipe comes out flakey and delicious every time.  I [grate the butter](http://www.eastmeetskitchen.com/tips/grating-your-butter.html) instead of using my fingers, which is less messy.  The dough is also freezable, so if you buy a couple disposable pie tins and press the dough in, you have pie crusts ready to go!

So this year, instead of buying pies from the store for Thanksgiving or Christmas, make it from scratch.  It's nicer, homier, and much more impressive.
