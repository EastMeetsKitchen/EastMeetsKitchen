Pork sparerib black bean rice was such a favorite of mine growing up.  I had it during dim sum, but it was also a really quick and easy meal my mom made for us just by throwing some marinated rice on top of the rice already cooking in the rice cooker.  The key is cooking all of the ingredients together with the rice.  All the black bean garlic sauce infuses into the rice at the end and it's just the perfect marriage of savory goodness.

The star of the show are the Chinese fermented black beans, which contain a mix of sweet spices, ginger and even orange peel.  It's really what gives this dish its unique flavor.  For those looking to take a quicker route, there is always a pre-prepared [black bean garlic sauce](http://amzn.to/2tNRLPa), which most people see at the grocery stores.

### Directions

1. Combine all the ingredients for the wrapper dough.  Knead until a dough ball forms and no longer sticks to the hands.  Add more wheat starch if needed.  Cover and set aside.
2. Combine all parts of the "meat filling."  Set aside and let marinade for 30 minutes.
3. In a pan with 2 tablespoons of oil over medium high heat, add in the diced carrots.  Cook for 2 minutes.  Add in the water chestnuts, mushrooms and prawns.  Stirfry for 1 minute.  Add inthe salt, chicken powder, white pepper and sesame oil.
4. Meanwhile, mix together the cornstarch, water and vegan oyster sauce.  Add it to the vegetable mixture.  Cook for another 1-2 minutes.  Put filling into a bowl to cool.
5. Add the chopped radish and cilantro to the cooled vegetable mixture.
6. On an oiled surface, divide the dough into 16 pieces.  Roll into 4-inch circles and fill with 1 tablespoon of filling.  Fold dough in half to form a semi-circle.  Pinch edges to seal.
7. Place dumplings onto a parchment lined steamer.  Steam on medium high heat for 8-10 minutes, or until the wrappers become clear.
8. Brush dumplings with a light layer of vegetable oil.  Serve while hot.
