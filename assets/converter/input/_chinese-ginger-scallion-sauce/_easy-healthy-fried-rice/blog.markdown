Fried rice is one of the ultimate Chinese takeout foods and it's one of the easiest recipes to make.  You can make it from leftovers and the ingredients are few and simple.  It usually includes rice, eggs, a meat (any you want - chicken, turkey, ham, spam) and veggies.  It's really simple.

Unfortunately, Chinese takeout restaurants tend to oversaturate the rice with oil and soy sauce.  Good fried rice is light and flavorful without being drowned in oil and flavoring agents.  Since the ingredients are so few, each should stand out and not be overpowered by each other.

I've made a "healthier" version by using half brown rice and half white rice.  Originally, the ingredients themselves aren't that bad for you anyway.  The only thing may be to watch the sodium in the meats you choose to use. 

__Tips For this Recipe__

- Use day old rice or rice that is cooled and not made with as much water.  This helps the rice not stick to one another, which can dense fried rice.
- Make sure to stir and break up the eggs as it is cooking to create fluffy small pieces.
