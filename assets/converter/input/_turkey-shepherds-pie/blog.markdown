Shepherd's pie is traditionally made with lamb - obviously because shepherds tend to lamb...or rather, sheep.  And so obviously, two days after turkey day, I'm making mine with turkey because well...I still have some left over - as well as mashed potatoes, a container of corn, and some gravy.

I'm keeping the ingredients list as simple as possible.  In fact, I'm listing them in the form of leftovers ie. 1 cup of mashed potatoes, 2 cups of gravy.  I want this to be an easy "throw whatever you didn't finish into a pot" type of dish.  And although they are leftovers, with the exception of a few ingredients, this is an absolutely delicious dish that gives you a different way to repurpose Thanksgiving food.
