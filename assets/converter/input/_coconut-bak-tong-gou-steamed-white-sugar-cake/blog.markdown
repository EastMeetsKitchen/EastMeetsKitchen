Steamed "white sugar" cake or "bak tong gou" is a pretty well-known item in Chinese bakeries.  It's the stuff I had as a kid when my parents would go to  Chinatown for groceries on Saturday mornings.  I would beg them to stop by the Chinese bakery to pick up some treats before heading home and bak tong gou was always one of the ones requested.  It's sort of this "jello meets sponge cake" cake that is slightly sweet and also slightly tangy.  (Yes, the Chinese do not like their cakes overly sweet, but this cake has a nice delicate balance I enjoy.)

I've never tried making bak tong gou before, but was always curious about how the whole "steaming a cake" would work.   To my surprise, the process of just making the cake was soemthing I had never seen before.  You cook the wet and dry ingredients together in a pan.  Let the mixture cool and add yeast.  Then you wait for the yeast to ferment and then the cake is ready for steaming.  Magic!   I think the novelty alone should make people want to try the recipe out.  But as it turns out, the cake is also super simple to make - requiring only about 3 or 4 ingredients.  I say 3 to 4 because I ended up putting coconut flavoring in mine, but if you're a traditionalist, then 3 ingredients is really all it takes to make this delicious steamed cake - sugar, rice flour, and yeast.

I actually researched quite a bit of recipes for this cake and settled on a recipe by a blogger, Wantanmien.  For those interested in authentic Cantonese recipes, check her out on YouTube. While the videos aren't too flashy (warning that she speaks in Cantonese, but provides amazing subtitles), they are delicious and very authentic.  Anyways, getting back to the recipes, some people cooked the batter before baking while some didn't.  Some added flavorings while others just stuck to the original.  Fermentation times differed a lot as well, but I find with this cake, longer is better.  

Yeast and the fermentation process is what gives this potentially bland cake its flavor - its tang.  I tried varying the fermentation times and for me, 6 hours (sometimes longer) tasted best.  Without that, the cake just didn't have enough flavor.  I also opted to add coconut milk to my bak tong gou, which really infused that richness into the cake, but I actually found that the richness from the coconut milk also took away from the delicate flavor of the bak tong gou itself.  So I guess if you wanted to put in flavoring, I would maybe try extracts, but your best bet is to go with the original recipe first, which is the one I will be providing.  

Some notes for this recipe are that if you do prefer your cakes to be sweeter, I would maybe add a tad more sugar to the recipe.  Also, because you are cooking the rice flour over a stove, the batter has a tendency to clump up if you don't whisk constantly.  If that happens, pull the pot off the stove and continue whisking until the lumps go away before returning to the stove.  The batter is actually quite forgiving, but remember to get the edges of the pot too so that the batter doesn't cook.  Also, the original recipe required steaming the cake in a bamboo steamer because it's porous, but if you have a rice cooker with a steaming attachment, you could use that or something similar.  I have seen people steam in cake pans as well.  The only thing with that is it may take a bit longer to cook.
