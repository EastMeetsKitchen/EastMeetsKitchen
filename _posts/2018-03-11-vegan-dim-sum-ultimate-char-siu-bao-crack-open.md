### Directions

1. Mix the ingredients of the starter together.  Cover with a wet towel and leave in a warm place for around 12 hours.
2. Add the water to the starter and mix until well combined.  Add in the cake flour.  If mix seems too dry, add 1-2 tablespoons more water as the dough should be moist.  Let rest in a warm place for an additional 8-10 hours.
3. In a mixer fitted with a dough hook on low to medium speed, add in the starter and sugar.  Turn mixer to medium and mix until sugar is dissolved, about 2-3 minutes.
4. In a separate bowl, mix together the cake flour, wheat starch and baking powder.  Set aside.
5. Add the alkaline water, shortening and rice vinegar to the mixer.  Mix for another 2-3 minutes until a smooth batter forms.
6. On low speed, add in the flour mix.  Turn speed up to medium once the flour is combined.  Knead for 7-8 minutes until the ingredients are well combined and the dough is malleable.
7. Turn the dough onto a floured surface.  Knead for an additional 1-2 minutes and form into a ball.  Cover with a lightly, damp towel and let rest for 30 minutes.
8. Divide the ball into 10 pieces and form into balls.
9. Using a rolling pin, roll each piece of dough into 5-inch disks, concentrating on the edges being a little thinner than the center.
10. Fill the wrapper with about 1 tablespoon of filling. Fold edges and seal by twisting the dough at the end.
11. Place the bao onto a square piece of parchment and into a steamer basket.
12. Once the steamer is hot, steam the baos on high heat for about 10 minutes until it begins to crack.
