The Mark's and Spencer's chocolate chunk shortbread cookie was the reason for my "Junior 15" back in my study abroad days in London.  I didn't have much money when I was there, but the one thing I had to stop for (nearly daily) was the Mark's and Spencer chocolate chunk cookie.  It wasn't a conscious decision.  I would be walking the London streets everyday after class or early in the morning during weekends.  Then as I pass the M&S doors, they would of course automatically slide open and out would come the biggest gust of buttery shortbread aroma.   Once that happened, I could never stand a chance.    

I happened to find a recipe from another blogger - Oleander and Palm (http://www.oleanderandpalm.com) that did her version of the M&S cookies.  I found them to be pretty darn good.  I thought it would be the perfect cookies for Valentine's Day.  Now I apologize because I didn't have heart cutters at home, so all of this was carved out by hand (impressive, I know).  Definitely give these a try.  Just a note is that these shortbread cookies aren't that sweet at all, so if you like it that way - then great.  But if you want to add a bit of sweetness, I'd suggest sprinkling on a little bit of sanding sugar before you bake it.  Also, be warned that these cookies do get more moist and less crumbly after the first day, so make sure to store it in an air tight container OR just eat them right away.  I bagged up some and gave them away to friends as well.
