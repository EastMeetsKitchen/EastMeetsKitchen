The recipe was definitely easier to make than a traditional pie crust recipe, but it fell victim to the typical downfalls a gluten free and dairy free recipe falls to - it was dry, sandy, and lacked good flavor.</p>\n<p>So what I ended up doing to bring in a little more flavor was to substitute canola oil for something a bit more fatty and flavorful - coconut oil, which essentially looks like softened butter.  Then I decided to add coconut flakes.  What the flakes did was that it added a much needed crunch to the crust, which dispersed throughout the somewhat sandy nature of the gluten free dough.  The result was an extremely delicious crust that was easy to make and did not include heavy ingredients which can weigh you down like butter and flour.</p>\n<p>For Gluten Free Crusts - sprinkle pieces of the dough into the pie pan, then press it in using a piece of plastic wrap.</p>\n<figure> <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;  max-width: 640px;\">\n      <a class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\" href=\"/static/de4a0c06d1e129d64e3227752d31e5ed/7459a/4-2.jpg\" style=\"display: block\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 75%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url(&apos;data:image/jpeg;base64,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&apos;); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"4 2\" title=\"4 2\" src=\"/static/de4a0c06d1e129d64e3227752d31e5ed/7459a/4-2.jpg\" srcset=\"/static/de4a0c06d1e129d64e3227752d31e5ed/90185/4-2.jpg 450w,\n/static/de4a0c06d1e129d64e3227752d31e5ed/7459a/4-2.jpg 640w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" loading=\"lazy\">\n  </a>\n    </span> </figure>\n<section class=\"recipe\">\n<p><strong>Recipe</strong></p></section>\n<p>(Makes 1 9-inch pie crush)</p>\n<ul><li>1 1/4 cups rice flour</li><li>1/2 cup sweet rice flour</li><li>1/2 cup tapioca starch</li><li>8 T coconut oil, chilled</li><li>5-8 T water, cold</li><li>5 T sweetened coconut</li></ul></section>","timeToRead":1,"excerpt":"This was a somewhat daring and optimistic attempt at making a pie crust, that in theory, would not taste good at all - a gluten free andâ€¦","frontmatter":{"title":"Gluten & Dairy-Free Coconut Pie Crust","image":{"feature":{"publicURL":"/static/4-1-58d946a66fbc4cfd0990e973bef7a21e.jpg","childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.4446952595936795,"src":"/static/58d946a66fbc4cfd0990e973bef7a21e/c73e5/4-1.jpg","srcSet":"/static/58d946a66fbc4cfd0990e973bef7a21e/00e5e/4-1.jpg 200w,\n/static/58d946a66fbc4cfd0990e973bef7a21e/1a903/4-1.jpg 400w,\n/static/58d946a66fbc4cfd0990e973bef7a21e/c73e5/4-1.jpg 640w","sizes":"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px"}}}},"feature_video":null,"date":"2014-03-03","categories":["recipes"],"tags":["recipes","sweets","healthy recipes","coconut","gluten-free","dairy-free","pie crust"]},"fields":{"slug":"/recipes/gluten-dairy-free-coconut-pie-crust","date":"2014-03-03T00:00:00.000Z"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/recipes/gluten-dairy-free-coconut-pie-crust","nextslug":"/blog/chinese-bbq-chuan-food-truck","prevslug":"/recipes/root-beer-pork-belly"}}}
