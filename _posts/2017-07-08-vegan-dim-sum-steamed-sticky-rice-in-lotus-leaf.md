If I had a favorite dim sum item I ordered as a kid, it would be "luo mai gai"
- stick rice filled with chicken, mushrooms and Chinese sausage all wrapped and perfumed in a lotus leaf.  I loved luo mai gai-s because they were substantial, kept me full and had all of these wonderful treasures inside.  I could always tell when the carts were bringing them by because it smelled of fragrant lotus leaves.

The most difficult part of this recipe is having to stand over the stove and stir the mixture for about 30 minutes until it reduces down.  But the result is an amazingly creamy, coconut-infused mixture that is delicious on anything.

A very important note to remember if you wish to unmold this cake is first, you need to freeze it.  The cake has a very soft set and if you want a neater presentation, freezing is a must.  Also, it is best to use a spring-form pan.  or to line your pan with parchment and transparent wrapping tape, otherwise the cake is not coming out.
