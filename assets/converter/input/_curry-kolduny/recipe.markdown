**Ingredients**
- 1 ounce ground chicken sausage
- 1 ounce ground turkey
- 2 ounces yellow onion, cut in small pieces
- 2 tablespoons curry powder
- 3/4 teaspoon salt
- 1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
- 14 ounces fresh potato, peeled and cut into small cubes
- 4 round tablespoons all-purpose flour
- 1/2 beaten egg
- 2 ounces vegetable oil

**Directions**
1. Mix the chicken, turkey, onions, 1/4 teaspoon salt and pepper and 2 tablespoons of curry powder. Form 3 thin patties about 4 1/2 inches in diameter.
2. Add the potatoes and remaining 1 ounce onions to a grinder and grind everything until the batter is smooth. Pour the batter in a bowl and add the flour, the remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt and the egg. Mix everything thoroughly. Form the batter into round thin pancakes.
3. Heat the oil in a pan. Place a potato pancake in the pan, topped with a meat patty and covered by more potato batter, covering all the meat. Fry the pancake on one side, about 1 minute. Flip it to the other side with a spatula, holding the top of the not-fried side with the fork. Make the fire smaller and cover the pan. Fry for 5 to 7 minutes, turning the pancakes over from time to time.
