It's early October and pumpkin season is finally here again.  You see evidence of it everywhere - in ice cream, in coffee, and even in potato chips! But if you're a beer or cider drinker, you know that Fall brings a myriad of pumpkin flavored potables, which are actually perfect additions for making dessert.

####Pumpkin Cider

I'm a New Englander, and nothing gets more New England (dessert-wise) than whoopie pies.  Pumpkin whoopie pies are a seasonal favorite, but adding pumpkin cider to the mix actually makes the cakes amazingly light.  If you're use to eating whoopie pies from a package, these fresh ones will knock your socks off.  They're fresher tasting and not cloyingly sweet.  The cakes are soft, and the cream cheese filling is light and airy.


###Directions

####1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit.

####2. In a bowl, combine dry flour, baking soda, baking powder, salt, and pumpkin spice.  Set aside.
