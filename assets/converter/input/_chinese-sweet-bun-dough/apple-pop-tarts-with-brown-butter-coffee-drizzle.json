{"description":"This is my first time making homemade pop tarts and oh my gosh, am I glad I did.  This probably goes to one of my top recipes.  The crust was one of the most flakey and crumbly crusts I've ever had. It makes the pop tart.  And because I had breakfast in mind (though I had all my pop tarts midday...like 5 minutes after they came out of the oven), I made a brown butter coffee drizzle to go over the top -- SO GOOD.\n","title":"Apple Pop Tarts with Brown Butter Coffee Drizzle","pic":"img/156-1.JPG"}
