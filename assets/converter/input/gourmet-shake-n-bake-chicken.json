    "description": "Chicken nuggets are something I love to eat whether it be from some chain store or just from an easy packet I pick up at the supermarket.  I think they're super versatile because you can have them as a snack, or on the night or nights you don't feel like cooking, you just pair these with a bowl of spaghetti and some sauce and you have yourself a pretty good tasting meal.",
