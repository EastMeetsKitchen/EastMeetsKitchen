**Ingredients**

(Makes 2 sets of rice buns) 
- 4-5 Tablespoons Olive Oil
- 2-3 Cups Cooked Rice
- Pinch of Salt

**Directions**
1. Generously oil muffin tins with olive oil.  Divide up 2 cups cooled rice into 4 muffin tins.  Use spoon to compress rice.  Put a sheet of plastic wrap over the rice and press down hard with ramekins.
2. Heat several tablespoons of oil in a non-stick frying pan on medium heat.  Un-mold the rice buns and fry each side for about 4 minutes. Salt as needed. Do not disturb the rice during browning as this will make it stick.  After 4 minutes, shake the pan to get buns to loosen.  A spatula can also be used to loosen the patty.
3. Put buns on a plate to dry and cool.  Use with sandwich meats and sauces as desired.
