So I recently started food styling and shooting for a local meal kit company in the Boston area.  This is your typical meal kit company, so the photos I do are here are somewhat different from foods I've styled in the past for a more artistic or even commercial setting.

 Before I start, I will say that I wasn't trained as a photographer, but over the years, have just read a ton on the subject, watched a ton of tutorials, and just casually shot and edited hundreds of photos for my own site. Oh right, and then there's Instagram.  I'll say that as the job has progressed, I've run into issues I've never had to deal with before, and from those issues, I'll research and look up how to solve the matter.  I think it's sort of on-the-job training, which may be an okay-substitute for someone who wasn't professionally-trained.  But I think nowadays, with so many amazing photographers, who were not professionally trained displaying their work on the internet, it is definitely possible for anyone to "learn as they go."

Anyways, I'm picturing this page to be more of an on-going blog, so I'll update as I go.  But first, here are just a couple of the initial recipe cards I've been working on.

__1. Lemon and Rosemary Sirloin__

As a vegan, this is as close eating beef as I get.  For this, I decided to make a well with the mashed potatoes, a technique I do with hummus and olive oil as well.
