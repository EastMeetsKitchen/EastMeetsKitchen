I've wanted to do one for the longest time, and it's just taken a while to play around different ingredients and to get the texture right.  I ended up using custard powder for the flavor and color, but also for texture as there was some cornstach in it.  Starch gives custards thickness and bounce, but it is not yield strong enough bonds to mimic the custard in an egg tart, which almost has a snap to it because of the eggs.  </p>\n<p>For that snap, I opted to use agar agar.  In my initial trials, I added to much agar powder and the result was a harder texture in my custard.  When I added additional liquids and fats, it softened the agar and what I was left with was a product very similar to the texture of an egg tart custard.  Upon feel, it may still seem like the custard is harder than traditional egg custards, but once you bite and taste it, the texture is actually a whole lot softer and smoother.</p>\n<figure class=\"ingredients\" markdown=\"1\">\n<p><strong>Vegan Dim Sum: Vegan Chinese Egg Tarts</strong></p>\n<p>(Makes 12 Servings)</p>\n<p><strong>Custard Filling:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>1/4 cup + 1 tablespoon water</li>\n<li>1/4 teaspoon agar powder</li>\n<li>1 1/2 teaspoons sugar</li>\n<li>1/2 cup coconut milk</li>\n<li>3/4 teaspoon custard powder</li>\n<li>several drops yellow food coloring, optional</li>\n<li>annato seeds, optional</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"http://eastmeetskitchen.com/videos/recipes/chinese-egg-tart-shells/\">Chinese Egg Tart Shells Recipe</a></p>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"directions\" markdown=\"1\">\n<h3 id=\"directions\"><a href=\"#directions\" aria-label=\"directions permalink\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Directions</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Pre-bake egg tart shells in a 350 degree Fahrenheit oven until lightly golden brown, about 20 minutes.
