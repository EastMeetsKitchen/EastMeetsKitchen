I love biscuits with my meals.  It's so much better than just your ordinary bread roll.  I love them plain, with butter, and oh, one time in a restaurant down in South Carolina, they served buttermilk biscuits with honey butter and that was to - die - for.  But I also love my biscuits savory.  You can pair them with so many things, and if you ever want to make a truly scrumptious sandwich, try these biscuits instead of white bread.

My feta and buttermilk biscuits are a little bit out of the ordinary in that most recipes, you see cheddar or some other melting cheese being added to the mix.  That makes sense and cheddar biscuits are one of my favorites, but adding feta cheese sort of lightens what could potentially be something quite heavy (and remember, biscuits are really accompaniments).  This biscuit has all the components a savory creation should and the feta paired with the red onions really make this a treat.  Yes, this biscuit is not as rich as its cheddar counterpart, but it is light, crumbly, and flavor-packed. It would be the perfect accompaniment to any main course.
