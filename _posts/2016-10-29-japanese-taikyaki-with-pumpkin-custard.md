Cheung fun or rice noodle rolls with peanut butter and hoisin sauce is one of my favorite street foods I have to pick up whenever I'm in Chinatown.  It has the perfect blend of sweet and savory hoisin sauce and creamy peanut butter.  Usually the soft rice noodles rolls, made from rolling up sheets of steamed rice batter, are mixed with fragrant bits of scallion and crunchy dried shrimp. If you are vegetarian or vegan, the shrimp can be omitted.

A lot of the recipe is creating the sauces and preparing the toppings.  It is more of an assembly type of dish, which is good because you don't have to do too much to enjoy this amazing street food, which you can find all over Hong Kong.

### Directions

1. For the filling, combine coconut milk and maple syrup in a pot.  
2.  Combine the cornstarch and almond milk until there are no lumps.  Pour into coconut mixture and bring to a slight boil while whisking.  Once mixture is thickened, turn off heat.
3. Add in the Earth Balance butter, salt and pumpkin puree.  Whisk until smooth.  Cover with plastic wrap and place in refrigerator for 30 minutes.
4. For the batter, combine the almond milk and apple cider vinegar.  Let sit for 15 minutes.
5. Meanwhile, combine the flour, baking powder, turmeric and salt.
6. Once the almond milk has thickened, whisk in the maple syrup and coconut oil.  Add in the dry mixture and whisk until combined.  Set batter aside.
7. To cook, heat taiyaki pan over medium heat for 4-5 minutes until pan is hot.  Brush pan with oil and pour in batter, moving it around to cover entire fish mould.  Cook for 3 minutes, checking for browning with skewer.
8. Once mixture has bubbled up and 3 minutes have passed, spoon on 1-2 tablespoons of filling onto the center.
9. Using a skewer, lift up the other half of the fish and place on top of the custard mixture.  Cook for an additional 30 seconds to 1 minute before flipping the pan and doing the same on the other side.
10. Can be eaten immediately.
