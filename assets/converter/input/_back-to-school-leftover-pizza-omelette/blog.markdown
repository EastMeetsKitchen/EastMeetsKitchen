It's almost time for back to school and I wanted to create a super easy and somewhat lazy menu for college students.  I wanted the ingredients to be cheap and things the students can find around their dorms and campus.  I stuck with easy equipment - no ovens, just microwaves, no whisks - just forks.  

I think these (four more to come) are recipes college kids should commit to memory.  Making your own food is a good way to save money, especially during the first couple years when you get out of school.

These meals definitely don't taste like leftover junk food and I think anyone would be happy coming to a brunch or dinner party with these foods served.  Keep in mind that ingredients can be subsituted.  Just use things you can find, keeping in mind that some greens and veggies will make this omelette look more appetizing.
