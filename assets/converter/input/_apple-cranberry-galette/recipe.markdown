**Ingredients**
(Makes 6 5-inch tarts)

For the crust:
- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 1/2 cup whole wheat flour
- 1/4 cup granulated sugar
- 1/8 teaspoon salt
- 1 1/4 sticks (cold unsalted butter, cut into small pieces)
- 4 tablespoons vegetable shortening
- 1 egg + 2 large egg yolks (1 egg for egg wash)
- 6 tablespoons ice water

For the filling:
- 3-4 Granny Smith apples, peeled and cut into small chunks
- 1/2 cup fresh cranberries
- 1/4 cup granulated sugar
- 1/4 cup light brown sugar
- 2 teaspoons fresh lemon juice
- 1 teaspoons finely lemon zest
- 1 teaspoons grated orange zest
- 1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon

**Directions**
1. Combine all dry ingredients with a fork and cut in pieces of chilled butter and shortening until pea sized and crumbly.  Add in egg yolks and cold water, 1 tablespoon at a time.  
2. Knead dough into a ball and refrigerate for 2 hours.
3. For filling: Mix apples, sugar, lemon juice, and cinnamon in a small sauce pan.  Over medium-high heat, cook apple mixture for about 5 minutes until juices are released.  Let sit and cool.  
4. Cut chilled dough into 6 pieces.  In 5 inch tart pans, press dough into pan measuring 3/8 inch for sides and slightly less for bottom.  Put leftover dough back in refrigerator for lattice work later.
5. Finish filling by straining out additional liquid from cooked apples and mix the apple mixture with fresh cranberries and the lemon and orange zest.  Put filling into pie shells.  Add a small piece of butter on top of each tart.
6. With leftover dough, roll out into 1/8 inch thick.  Cut 1/4 inch strips and make lattice over the fruit going over and under with each strip.
7. Brush galettes with egg wash and sugar. Bake galettes over a sheet pan for 40 minutes in a 425 degree oven.
